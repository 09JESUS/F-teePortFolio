Cybersecurity Enthusiast & Developer
I'm a final year Information Technology student at North-West University (NWU), specializing in cybersecurity and software development. My passion lies in creating secure, efficient solutions that solve real-world problems.

I'm the founder of FSolution.-Dev, a web development company where I create custom websites for clients as a part-time job. I leverage modern technologies like React and Tailwind CSS to deliver exceptional digital experiences.

My goal is to build a career at the intersection of cybersecurity and software engineering, where I can help organizations protect their digital assets while creating innovative solutions.
